# OlympicBanner
Add container to a UIViewController that uses a child UIViewController as a page controller with pages containing a UICollectionView that responds to the number of items in the data source and the width of the collection view.  This is similar the the Apple News banner for the Winter Olympics (2018) that ran for a time.

The banner also has a simple animation to simulate snowflakes falling.
